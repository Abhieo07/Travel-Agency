# Nymble SDE Internship Assignment

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my solution for the Nymble Software Development Engineer (SDE) Internship assignment! This README will walk you through how I tackled the problem, the structure of my solution, and how you can run the code yourself.

## Folder Structure
- The repository is organized into the following directories:
  - `src`: Contains the Java source code for the implementation of the travel package management system.
  - `test`: Contains the JUnit test cases to validate the functionality of the implemented classes.

## Running the Tests
- To run the tests, you can execute the JUnit test classes located in the `test` directory.
- Ensure that you have JUnit set up in your development environment.

## Output
- Run `Main.java` to get the output as following
1. Print itinerary of the travel package including: 
    1. travel package name, 
    2. destinations and details of the activities available at each destination, like name, cost, capacity and description.
2. Print the passenger list of the travel package including: 
    1. package name, 
    2. passenger capacity, 
    3. number of passengers currently enrolled and 
    4. name and number of each passenger
3. Print the details of an individual passenger including their 
    1. name, 
    2. passenger number, 
    3. balance (if applicable), 
    4. list of each activity they have signed up for, including the destination the at which the activity is taking place and the price the passenger paid for the activity.
4. Print the details of all the activities that still have spaces available, including how many spaces are available.
